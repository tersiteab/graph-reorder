## Contents of this folder: ##

  **gem5**:
    -Contains an older version of gem5 modified to implement OMEGA functionality

  **benchmarks:**
    -Contains the C++ source files for OMEGA-accelerated and baseline versions of GraphIt:
      -PageRank
      -Breadth-First Search (BFS)
      -Connected Components (CC)
      -Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
      
    -Each algorithm's directory contains:
      -graphit_compiled: C++ source files for OMEGA-accelerated (acc) and baseline (std) implementations of the algorithm with different apply directions (SparsePush, DensePull, SparsePush-DensePull). Note that PageRank does not have a SparsePush-DensePull implementation (since the number of active vertices does not change, the Push-Pull just adds overhead).
      -executables_16  : Pre-compiled and tested executables for each C++ source file configured to run 16 threads (what we evaluate with)
      -executables_1   : Same as 'executables_16', but configured to run 1 thread
      
    -OMEGA_API.cpp and OMEGA_API.h: provide functions that we use to interact with OMEGA's hardware features
    
    -gem5_run_std.sh: runs gem5 in our baseline configuration
      -Usage: gem5_run_std.sh <exe_path> <input_args>
        -<exe_path>  : path to the executable to run
        -<input_args>: input arguments (e.g. path to an input graph)
    
    -gem5_run_acc.sh: runs gem5 in our OMEGA configuration
      -Usage: gem5_run_acc.sh <vertexline_size> <exe_path> <input_args>
        -<vertexline_size>: the number of bytes in each line of scratchpad memory; this should match the size of elements mapped to SPM
       
        
## Building and running gem5: ##

  -This version of gem5 has compatibility issues with newer versions of Ubuntu, so we'll be using Docker to have an Ubuntu 16.04 environment with the required packages installed.
  
  -On poisonivy, running the command "docker images" should return something like:
   
        REPOSITORY        TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED      SIZE
        aura_16.04_gem5   latest    ae02b88a2145   2 days ago   549MB
        
  -"ae02b88a2145" is the modified Ubuntu 16.04 image that we'll be using to create a Docker container
  -To run this image in a Docker container, I recommend using the command:
  
    docker run -u $UID:$GID --volume <path>:/volume_files --rm -it ae02b88a2145
    
  -Where <path> is the path to this folder (the one that contains "gem5" and "benchmarks")
  -After starting the container and running the command "ls" you should see something like:
  
    I have no name!@5debf2e92150:/$ ls
    bin  boot  dev	etc  home  lib	lib64  media  mnt  opt	proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var	volume_files
    I have no name!@5debf2e92150:/$ 

  -You can ignore the "I have no name"; the string after @ is the container ID and will vary
  -The directory "volume_files" is the directory that you specified via <path>. Any files contained in this directory will be accessible while in this Docker container and any changes to the directory contents will persist after the container is closed.
  
  -To build gem5, navigate to the gem5 directory and run the command:
  
    scons build/X86/gem5.opt PROTOCOL=MESI_Two_Level -j12
    
  -To run any of the pre-built executables, first navigate to the benchmarks directory
  
    -Example for a baseline app:
    
      ./gem5_run_std.sh pagerank/executables/std/pagerank_pull
  
    -Example for an OMEGA app:
    
      ./gem5_run_acc.sh 8 pagerank/executables/acc/pagerank_pull-omega
  
    -For the included OMEGA apps, the following vertexline_sizes (first argument for gem5_run_acc.sh) should be used:
      -PageRank: 8 (since it maps doubles to SPM)
      -BFS:      4 (since it maps ints to SPM)
      -CC:       4 (since it maps ints to SPM)
      -SSSP:     4 (since it maps ints to SPM)
  
  -To exit the Docker container, run: "exit"
  

## Building OMEGA-accelerated Executables ##
  
  -I've included the C++ source files for the pre-built executables mostly as a reference. If you need to modify and build these executables (or some other application) yourself to run on OMEGA/this version of gem5, let me know and we can discuss the process. The build process is somewhat fussy and difficult to explain just in text.

PS. The benchmark applications have been modified to log runtime to a 'log.txt' file in the current directory. modified benchmark apps are provided in ```./benchmarks``` folder. an assertion error could be thrown because of modifications to the apps, and the hack provided in the above building process should be applied to get them working.
